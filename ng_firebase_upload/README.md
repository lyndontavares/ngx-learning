## Download and run the application
- If you have not installed angular-cli, you have to install it: `npm install angular-cli --save`
- Clone this repo and enter inside the folder
- run `npm install`
- run `ng serve`

## Live demo

You can see this project running in **Firebase Hosting** in this URL: [https://upload-582a4.firebaseapp.com/](https://upload-582a4.firebaseapp.com/)

If you want to see working the **Firebase Realtime Database** then you can open two different browsers, one with the **List Images** page and the other one with the **Upload Images** page. Then you will see that when you upload images they will be displayed automatically in the **list images** page.
